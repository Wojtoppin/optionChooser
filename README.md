## Introduction

Option Chooser is a React-based project currently in the process of development. It utilizes the [Argon Dashboard React](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/argon-dashboard-react?ref=adr-github-readme) template by Creative Tim.

## How It Works

1. **Insert Data:**
   - Upload an Excel file with your data or manually add properties. These will be used as columns for the decision-making process.

2. **Initiate Processing:**
   - Click the "Send" button to trigger the processing of your data.

3. **Data Analysis:**
   - If you uploaded an Excel file, all columns and rows should be automatically filled. If not, add rows manually by clicking the green button and filling the empty boxes with your values.

4. **Finalize Selection:**
   - Click the "Send" button again to process your data and generate a chart.

5. **Chart Analysis:**
   - A chart is displayed, showcasing the best option based on your specified properties. You can change the sorting properties by clicking on the property names above the chart.

## Project Usability

Option Chooser is designed to assist you in decision-making across various scenarios, such as:
- Product comparisons (e.g., cars, processors)
- Decision-making in complex systems
- Evaluating options in politics or other fields where multiple factors influence the decision.
